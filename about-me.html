				<h1>About me.</h1>
				<p>
					My name is James Phelps and I want to first thank you for having a look at my portfolio. I
					got into web development when I was 14, of course I did not quite understand what web
					development was or what I was even doing. I created obscure websites with my dad, mostly
					about space and our thoughts on the future of space. However, as things go I stopped and
					completely forgot the fun I had.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fast forward to my Masters, where we were given the opportunuty to learn Python and my
					passion for web development took off. Since then and into the days of Covid, I have not
					stopped creating, designing and developing all things related to coding and web
					development.
				</p>
				<p>
					From learning on Codecademy and Treehouse to creating websites for clients, tacking
					questions on Codewars and developing immersive projects. All of which has led me to become
					a thoughtful, unique programmer with a passion in Front-end web developemnt.
