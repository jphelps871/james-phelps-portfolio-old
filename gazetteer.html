					<h2>Gazatteer</h2>
					<section>
						<p>
							Given a brief to develop a gazetteer, a map that displays information on countries and
							points of interest, I was able to design and develop a great user experience for
							exploring multiple countries from around the world. The design aimed to present
							information to the user with as little interactions as possible, by incorporating
							API’s such as geolocation and developing preloaders. The real learning curve for
							myself was juggling multiple API’s from sources such as RapidAPI, and trudging through
							multiple documentations that relate to something found in a Gazetteer. After
							collecting all relevant data, it was important to handle all possible errors and
							display the correct information.
						</p>
						<p>
							Below is an example of what a user will first see when reaching the website, a simple
							preloader that when also displays how the website works.
						</p>

						<p>
							When first developed, many users were struggling with the overall functionality of the
							website. Working within an agile environment the design was adapted multiple times
							that created a better user experience. As you can see, the first image (design one)
							appears less rounded with more clutter whereas, the second image (design two) is
							clearer and shows more of the map.

							Thank you for having a read, please feel free to visit the website and explore the
							world!
